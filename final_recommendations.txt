BUSINESS PROBLEM
─────────────────
CloudSub Inc. experienced slowing revenue growth despite steady new 
customer acquisition. This analysis investigated churn patterns, 
revenue leakage, and customer lifetime value across all plan types 
to identify the root cause and recommend corrective actions.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FINDING 1 — Basic Plan Churn is Destroying Revenue
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Basic plan customers churn at 94.59% vs 10.97% for Enterprise
- Basic customers only stay for an average of 7.6 months
- Their CLV is only $221 vs $4,977 for Enterprise customers
- Despite being 50% of the customer base, Basic contributes 
  the least retained revenue ($1,566 active MRR remaining)

RECOMMENDATION:
→ Introduce a mid-tier plan between Basic and Pro to give 
  Basic customers a natural upgrade path
→ At month 3 (peak churn window), trigger an automated 
  upgrade offer with 20% discount for first 3 months
→ Expected impact: 15% reduction in Basic churn = 
  ~$4,100 additional MRR retained per month

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FINDING 2 — Failed Payments Are a Major Churn Signal
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- 59.58% of all churned customers had a failed payment 
  in the 30 days before they cancelled
- This means churn was PREDICTABLE for 6 in 10 customers
- The company had a 30-day window to intervene but had 
  no automated system in place

RECOMMENDATION:
→ Implement an automated dunning (payment recovery) system:
   Day 1: Automated email — payment failed, retry link
   Day 3: SMS reminder with direct payment update link
   Day 7: Account pause warning with support chat offer
   Day 14: Final notice before cancellation
→ Industry benchmark: dunning systems recover 20-30% 
  of at-risk accounts
→ Expected impact: Recovering 20% of 488 at-risk customers 
  = ~98 customers saved per cycle

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FINDING 3 — Enterprise Customers Are Carrying the Business
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Enterprise has only 10.97% churn vs 94.59% for Basic
- Enterprise CLV ($4,977) is 22x higher than Basic ($221)
- Enterprise active MRR ($113,316) dwarfs all other segments
- Only 319 Enterprise customers generate more revenue than 
  999 Basic + 682 Pro customers combined

RECOMMENDATION:
→ Shift acquisition budget toward Enterprise segment
→ Create a dedicated Customer Success Manager role for 
  Enterprise accounts to keep churn below 5%
→ Build an Enterprise referral program — a single 
  Enterprise referral is worth 22 Basic customers

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FINDING 4 — Churn is Accelerating Over Time
─────────────────────────────────────────────
- Churn rate grew from 0.05% in Jan 2022 to 3.3% by Sep 2023
- That is a 66x increase in churn over 18 months
- Early cohorts (2022) lose 50% of customers within 12 months
- This trend will continue to worsen without intervention

RECOMMENDATION:
→ Set a company-wide churn KPI target of below 2% monthly
→ Build a real-time churn monitoring dashboard (like this one)
  reviewed in weekly leadership meetings
→ Conduct exit surveys for all churned customers to capture 
  qualitative reasons beyond payment failure

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SUMMARY OF IMPACT IF RECOMMENDATIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Total revenue currently lost to churn:         $75,426
- Estimated recovery with dunning system:    ~$15,000/month
- Estimated saving by reducing Basic churn:   ~$4,100/month
- Total estimated monthly revenue recovery:  ~$19,100/month
- Annualized impact:                        ~$229,200/year
